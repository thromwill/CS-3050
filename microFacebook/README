microFacebook

This program was written during my second semester sophomore year for CS 3050,
and advanced algorithm design course taught in C. The goal of this design is to develop
and understanding of hashtables through their implementation. Input is taken from the
console, where users can create people to be stored in the microFacebook database.

Commands:
  P - <name> ---------- Create a person record of the specified first name.
  F - <name1> <name2> - Record that the two specified people are friends.
  U - <name1> <name2> - Record that the two specified people are no longer friends.
  L - <name> ---------- Print out the friends of the specified person.
  Q - <name1> <name2> - Check whether the two people are friends.
  X ------------------- Terminate the program.
