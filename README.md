# CS-3050

These programs were developed for this algorithm design course during my second semester sophomore year. These three projects were each implemented in a way to develop an understanding of hashtable, binary tree variations, and graphs. Microfacebook uses hashtables to store basic user data, RedBlackTree obviously uses red and black trees in a very straightforward way, and Elevator focuses on the depth first search (DFS) algorithm to implement a solution.
